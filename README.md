# ðŸ§  Meta-Learning for Extremely Imbalanced Classification

This project implements a **modular meta-learning framework** for binary classification tasks with **extreme class imbalance** (e.g. 0.1% positive class). It integrates advanced techniques from recent research in meta-learning, boundary enhancement, ensemble fusion, and uncertainty modeling.
